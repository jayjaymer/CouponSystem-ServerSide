# Jay_couponSystem_v1.2
first java project by Eugene

Hey my name is Eugene, this is my first fully sized project.

This project is part of my fullstack java training via John Bryce college,
The Coupon System project will cover the Server & Client sides,
so the end result will contain a fully operating web (Front & Back end) with the right premissions for each client type.

Here some details about what technologies i will use, and some of the principles :

@Server side(to be updated) -

First Part - Core JDBC using MySQL 
based on Java - (Threads, JDBC, DAO, Java Beans, OOP, Custom Querys)

Second Part - Spring (framework)
Core, Boot, Data

@Client side(to be updated) -

Here i will expand on my project details.
